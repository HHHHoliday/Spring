# Spring
Some Demos about Spring

If you want to import these demos into your compiler like IDEA and execute successfully, you need to complete the following stepsï¼š
1.Right click the module, choose the 'Add Frameworks Support' and click 'Web Application'(Version 4.0) to let this module become a web project.
2.Click 'Project Structure'(maybe in the upper right corner of the screen if you use IDEA), then choose 'Artifacts' to create a new directory named 'lib' for each module in the 'Output Layout'.
3.Choose this 'lib' and click the '+' sign to add 'Library Files'(then you can choose all of them).
4.Open 'Edit Run/Debug configuration dialog' to add a new configuration, click '+' sign and chose 'Tomcat Server' (Note:choose the Local one), my version is Tomcat 8.5.35.
